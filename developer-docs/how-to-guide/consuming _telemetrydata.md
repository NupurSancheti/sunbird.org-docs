## Scenario

As a part of the employee development and training program, the XYZ Corporation has to create training material. The Learning and Develop department's admin would like to effectiveness of the courses. To determine the effectiveness, the admin must have telemetry data and analyze the data to analyse the time consumption on each content.

## Overview

Telemetry is an automated remote measurement and data collection process. It is used in all kinds of industries, from tracking spacecraft, tracking wildlife, medical monitoring, law enforcement, and so on.

**Telemetry Event Specifications**

Telemetry events are broad, human-readable actions, that can be tracked as a string. Events are used to categorize telemetry data. They are the basic unit for analytics and help identify user navigation or flow. All events follow a common data structure, though the event data structure ("edata") differs for each event. 

All events data is captured via a common event JSON structure. Depending on the event, edata element carries event specific data. All events have unique event codes (IDs).

The complete data structure is as follows:
```javascript
{
  //About the event
  "eid": , // Required.
  "ets": , // Required. Epoch timestamp of event (time in milli-seconds. For ex: 1442816723)
  "ver": , // Required. Version of the event data structure, currently "3.0"
  "mid": , // Required. Unique message ID. Used for deduplication, replay and update indexes

  //Who did the event
  "actor": { // Required. Actor of the event.
    "id": , // Required. Can be blank. The id of the actor. For eg: u`id in case of an user
    "type":  // Required. Can be blank. User, System etc.
  },

  //Context of the event
  "context": { // Required. Context in which the event has occured.
    "channel": , // Required. The channel which has produced the event
    "pdata": { // Optional. Producer of the event
      "id": , // Required. unique id assigned to that component
      "pid": , // Optional. In case the component is distributed, then which instance of that component
      "ver":  // Optional. Version number of the build
    },
    "env": , // Required. A unique environment where the event has occurred
    "sid": , // Optional. Session id of the requestor stamped by portal
    "did": , // Optional. Uuid of the device created during app installation
    "cdata": [{ // Optional. Correlation data
      "type":"", // Required. Used to indicate action that is being correlated
      "id": "" // Required. The correlation ID value
    }],
    "rollup": { // Optional. Context rollups
      "l1": "",
      "l2": "",
      "l3": "",
      "l4": ""
    }
  },

  // What is the target of the event
  "object": { // Optional. Object which is the subject of the event
    "id": , // Required. The ID of the object. For eg: content id in case of content
    "type": , // Required. Type of the object. For eg: "Content", "Community", "User" etc
    "ver": , // Optional. Version of the object
    "rollup": { // Optional. Rollups to be computed of the object. Only 4 levels are allowed
      "l1": "",
      "l2": "",
      "l3": "",
      "l4": ""
    }
  },

  // What is the event data
  "edata": {} // Required.

  // Tags
  "tags": [""] // Optional. Encrypted dimension tags passed by respective channels
}
```

The level of data collected is a discrete decision of an organization or business. Analysis of this data offers insights into product and user behavior and usage patterns, driving business decisions and research outcomes.

## Intended Audience

 Admin and analyst

## Prerequisites

* Get an API Key to access Sunbird APIs. To create an API key refer [How to generate a Sunbird API key](developer-docs/how-to-guide/generate_apikey)

* Software that can make rest API calls, like curl or POSTMAN

* Install the server instance of Sunbird. For details, refer [Server Installation](developer-docs/server-installation)

* The root organization and sub-organizations created and their organsationId and root organization’s channel readily available

* Instrumenting your App for Telemetry and Analytics

* Enabling telemetry service 

* Partner/Content App must send telemetry using Telemetry SDK to record telemetry

## Workflow

The process of streaming and consuming telemetry data uses three core components:
• Telemetry Policy File: Determines the kind of telemetry data to be generated, at a specified frequency

• Telemetry Encoder: Encapsulates the generated data into the desired format and transfer tothe receiver

• Telemetry Receiver: It is the remote management system that stores the telemetry data

### Pulling and extracting data using data exhaust API 

Using Data exhaust API, you can get workflow summary or raw data generated as by product of user activities. Data exhaust also helps in data mining analytics.

**Authorization**

bearer

Security scheme type: API Key
header parameter name: Authorization

UserToken

Security scheme type: API Key
header parameter name: x-authenticated-user-token

**Submit Data Request**

This API is used to submit the data request to get the exhaust data. The response of the request initiates the creation of a data file. This data file can be downloaded and used for analytics etc.

<b>Header Parameters</b>

* Specify the authorization key that you have received from the administrator.
Note: To make use of the API, you require authorization. Raise a request to the administrator for the use of the API. You will receive the authorization key. Specify the key received here.

* Custom the header parameter as per the request

X-Channel-ID: {{channel id}}

Content-Type: application/json

Authorization: Bearer {{api_key}}

**REQUEST BODY**

The body refers to the format of the request. It contains metadata about the data request to be sent
```javascript
{
  "id": "ekstep.data_exhaust_dataset_service",
  "ver": ",1.0",
  "ts": "2015-08-04T17:36:36+05:30",",

      "tags": [
        "string"
      ]
    },
    "output_format": "string"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

This API returns the dataset based on **fromDate** and **toDate**

Response body sample with indicative values:

``` javascript
{
    "id": "org.xyz.analytics.telemetry",
    "ver": "1.0",
    "ts": "2018-11-15T12:35:37.522+00:00",
    "params": {
        "resmsgid": "e7e8f75d-fcc2-4f4f-96a1-ab48257591b5",
        "status": "successful",
        "client_key": null
    },
    "responseCode": "OK",
    "result": {
        "telemetryURLs": [
            **"https://xyzproductionall.blob.core.windows.net/telemetry-data-store/channel/01235953112556064029750/raw/2018-10-01-1538393108525.json.gz"**
        ],
        "expiresAt": 1542287137444
    }
}

```
Note:

* fromDate and toDate must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
 **toDate** must be greater than or equal to** fromDate** and **toDate** must be less than today. 

* Maximum one month’s (31 days) data could be downloaded in one API call.

* The request.licensekey is required for accessing the data exhaust. 

**Responses Code:**

In case of error, an appropriate error response is returned.

400 BAD REQUEST,Submit Data Request operation failed! The possible reason for failure is that you may have missed providing input for a mandatory parameter

500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR. We track these errors automatically and try to set it right at the earliest. Try refreshing the page. If the problem still persists, contact us at info@sunbird.org.

 
**Extracting Data:**

Using the telemetry URL that you recieve as a response body of data exhaust API, you can extract thefile ( .gzip format) that contains telemetry log

Paste a telemetry URL on a browser and enter, a .gzip file is downloaded on your local.

Conver the file and store to server/cloud storage using json.

### Analyzing the Data

Analyst can now retrive the data stored on the server/cloud storage and analysys the data based on the use case and scenario using some analytics portal.

1. Analyst must first apply filter for a content based on the content ID.

<b>Filters to apply</b>:

For App content sessions:

"dimensions.pdata.id" = "prod.diksha.app" & "dimensions.mode" = "play" & "dimensions.type" in ("content","player")

For Portal content sessions:

"dimensions.pdata.id" = "prod.diksha.portal" & "dimensions.mode" = "play" & "dimensions.type" = "content"

2. To calculate the overall time spent on a content, analyst must consider and calculate the parameters like edata  (eks, time spent) from the [workflow summary](https://github.com/ekstep/Common-Design/wiki/[Data-Product]-Workflow-Summarizer) data.
```javascript
"edata": {
        "eks": {
            "start_time": Long, // Epoch Timestamp of start. Retrieved from first event.
            "end_time": Long, // Epoch Timestamp of end. Retrieved from last event.
            "time_spent": Double, // Total time spent in seconds excluding idle time.
            "time_diff": Double, //  Diff between the last event and first event in seconds.
            "interact_events_count": Long, // Count of interact events
            "interact_events_per_min": Double, // Count of interact events per minute
            "telemetry_version": String, //Version of the telemetry 1.0 or 2.0
            "env_summary": [{
                "env": String, // High level env within the app (content, domain, resources, 

                  community)
                "time_spent": Double, // Time spent per env
                "count": Long // count of times the environment has been visited
            }],
```
